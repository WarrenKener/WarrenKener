- 👋 Hi, I’m @WarrenKener :) 
- 👀 I’m interested in creating software tools for webcam streamers & audience members!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript, and am learning as I go with Chrome extension manifest v3 & MongoDB/Express/Node. Always wrestling with CSS, occasionally with regexps.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on software that helps improve the webcam streaming ecosystem for everyone.
- 📫 I can be reached at warrenkener@gmail.com :D
